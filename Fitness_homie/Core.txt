Advanced workout
Deadlift-
Deadlift reintroduces us to our backside - hamstrings, glutes, erector spinae, multifidus essentially anything in the posterior chain and more. Helping us to stand taller and with greater strength
Use a moderate weight (60% of your 1 rep max)- 8x3

Weighted dips-
Weighted dips are an advanced variation of the classic dip exercise that uses external weight to increase the intensity and challenge the muscles more effectively. They primarily work the chest, triceps, and shoulders, along with some assistance from the back muscles. 
Do regular dips until you can do 10 reps 
Slowly gradually increase the weight as you get stronger. 

weighted pull up-
Weighted pull-ups are a variation of pull-ups where additional weight is added to increase the difficulty and challenge the muscles involved. This is typically achieved by using a weight belt, weight vest, or by hanging weights from a harness or dip belt. Adding weight to pull-ups can lead to greater strength gains and muscle development. 
Add weights after you can achieve 10 pull-ups with no struggle and gradually increase the weight.
